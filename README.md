# SnifLeaf – macOS Network Proxy & HTTP Inspector

**SnifLeaf** is a lightweight, native macOS app built with SwiftUI that captures and analyzes HTTP/HTTPS traffic in real time, powered by [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). It's ideal for developers, testers, and network debuggers who want a fast, focused alternative to tools like Charles Proxy.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hgq287/SnifLeaf.git
open SnifLeaf.xcodeproj
```

- Requires: macOS 15+, Xcode 16+

> `mitmdump` is already bundled and invoked via CLI by the app. No manual installation is needed.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure System Proxy**

   - System Settings → Network → Your Wi-Fi → Proxy → Enable Web Proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)

2. **Install SSL Certificate**

   - With the proxy running, visit http://mitm.it in your browser
   - Download the certificate and trust it via Keychain Access (macOS only)

> These steps are mandatory for HTTPS traffic interception due to macOS security restrictions.
